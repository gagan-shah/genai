How you’d plug this into your system

Replace the hard-coded VehicleETAInput in main() with:

Current GPS from your tracking system.

Destination from your shipment/route table.

ETA from user or planning system.

Call evaluate_eta() every X minutes (or when new GPS comes).

If result.alert is True, send result.llm_explanation as:

SMS / WhatsApp / email / dashboard notification.

If you want, I can next:

Wrap this into a FastAPI REST endpoint (POST /eta-check)

Or extend it to consider historical average speed per route or driver instead of a fixed avg_speed_kmph
